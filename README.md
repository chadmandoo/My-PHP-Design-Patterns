# My design pattern examples
This repo is various design patterns that I come across during
development. This is meant for a reference and anyone interested
in how certain patterns work in php.

## Composition over Inheritance
This is located in src/Composition and shows the benefits of
using composition over inheritance. This example uses a Duck and
is based off of the Head First Design Patterns chapter 1.

## Observer
This is located in src/Observer and shows the benefits of using
an Observer pattern. The example is taken from Head First Design
Patterns using a Weather Data fictional program.
