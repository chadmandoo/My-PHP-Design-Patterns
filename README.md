# My design pattern examples
This repo is various design patterns that I come across during
development. This is meant for a reference and anyone interested
in how certain patterns work in php.

## Active Record Pattern
Example of an Active Record Pattern for centralize database access.

## Strategic Pattern (Composition over Inheritance)
This is located in src/Composition and shows the benefits of
using composition over inheritance. This example uses a Duck and
is based off of the Head First Design Patterns chapter 1.

## Decorator Pattern
Example of a Decorator pattern using a Weapon and Damage modifiers as examples.

## Observer Pattern
This is located in src/Observer and shows the benefits of using
an Observer pattern. The example is taken from Head First Design
Patterns using a Weather Data fictional program.

## Singleton Pattern
Example of a very basic Singleton pattern. One of the easiest patterns to implement.
