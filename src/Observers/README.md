# Observer Pattern

## Definition
Defines a subject that maintains a list of its dependents (Observers) and notifies them automatically of any state changes.

## Benefits of Strategy Pattern

* Loose Coupling. Observers and Subjects have little knowledge of each other.
* Observers can be added at any time, replaced, or removed.
* Changes on both Observers and Subjects wont affect the other.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
