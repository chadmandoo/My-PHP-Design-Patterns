## Definition
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Benefits of Strategy Pattern

* Has A relationship. Instead of inheriting unwanted functionality we favor composition over inheritance.
* Change behavior at runtime.
* Can still inherit behavior.
* Make dynamic runtime decisions.
* Add behavior without altering existing code. Including behavior unknown to the creator.
